In Java, Access modifiers help to restrict the scope of a class, constructor, variable, method, or data member.
It provides security, accessibility, etc to the user depending upon the access modifier used with the element.

Types of Access Modifiers in Java
There are four types of access modifiers available in Java:

        Default â€“ No keyword required (accessible only within the same package)
        Private (accessible only within the class in which they are declared)
        Protected (accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages)
        Public (accessible from anywhere within the program)

NOTE: Top level classes cannot have access modifier private and protected
