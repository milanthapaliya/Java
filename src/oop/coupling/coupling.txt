Coupling in Java refers to the degree of interdependence between two or more classes. It is a measure of how tightly connected two classes are.

There are two types of coupling in Java:

Tight coupling: This is when two classes are highly dependent on each other. Changes to one class often require changes to the other class. An example of tight coupling in Java is when a class directly instantiates another class.
Loose coupling: This is when two classes are less dependent on each other. Changes to one class do not usually require changes to the other class. An example of loose coupling in Java is when a class uses an interface to interact with another class.

Loose coupling is generally considered to be better than tight coupling because it makes code more modular and reusable. When classes are loosely coupled, they can be easily changed or replaced without affecting other parts of the code.

Here are some examples of coupling in Java:

Tight coupling:
    A class that directly instantiates another class.
    A class that calls a method on another class by its name.
    A class that passes a reference to another class as a parameter.
Loose coupling:
    A class that uses an interface to interact with another class.
    A class that uses a dependency injection framework to inject dependencies into its objects.
    A class that uses a message broker to communicate with another class.

The best way to achieve loose coupling in Java is to use interfaces and dependency injection frameworks. Interfaces allow classes to interact with each other without knowing about each other's implementation details. Dependency injection frameworks make it easy to inject dependencies into objects, which can help to reduce coupling.

Here are some tips for reducing coupling in Java:

    Use interfaces instead of concrete classes.
    Use dependency injection frameworks.
    Avoid hard-coding dependencies.
    Use abstract classes and subclasses.
    Use polymorphism.
