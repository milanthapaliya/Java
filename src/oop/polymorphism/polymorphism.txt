Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows
you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means
forms, So it means many forms.

Types of Java polymorphism
In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

    1. Compile-time / Static Polymorphism(method overloading, operator overloading)
    2. Runtime / Dynamic Polymorphism(method overriding)
